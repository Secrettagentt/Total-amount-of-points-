# Total-amount-of-points-



["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4
